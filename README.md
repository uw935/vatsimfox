## About
**VATSIM Fox** — helps you to view profile stastic easily. Here you can see your last 50 flightplans / 100 ATC shifts.

Project based on [Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) API](https://vatsim.dev/).

Written in Python 3.7.10 + JS (JQuery framework) + Boostrap

## Startup
For run application on your own machine, you must install docker. Then just one command in the "src" folder with the project source code:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Contibution
Any help with this project would be greatly appreciated. Fixes or some features are welcome.

More information about the contributing to this project will appear there a little later.

## Feature
There is small TODO list I would like to make in this project:

- [x] Create docker
- [x] Deploy to webserver with domain
- [ ] More ATC information — add map with control area
- [ ] More profile information — add some more info, not only date of registration. Maybe rating or something
- [ ] Website redesign
- [ ] Challenges, like: "fly to this country N times", or "fly to all countries around the world", etc
